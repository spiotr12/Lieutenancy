                        The county of Kincardineshire has existed for many centuries and was a separate Local Authority
                        area until 1975 but is now within the administrative area of the Aberdeenshire Council.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The historic counties of Aberdeenshire and Banffshire still remain and have their own Lord
                        Lieutenant. It is important to note that the Lieutenancies are quite separate from the Local
                        Authority areas.

                Kincardineshire still exists as the ancient county title with defined geographical boundries. The Lord
                Lieutenant is Her Majesty the Queen's representative for the country. Aberdeenshire is only the name of
                the Local Authority and not part of the postal address. Please continue to use "Kincardineshire" as your
                postal address, as permitted by Royal Mail
